Sorting visualizer

Implemented:
Profiling sorting algorithms on N elements with a step.
Implemented algorithms:
bubble sort;
shaker sort;
comb sort;
insertion sort;
selection sort;
quick sort;
merge sort;
heap sort;
Based on the profiling results, the dependences of the operating time on the number of elements are built.
The examples (plots) you can see at /examples.

CMake 3.10 required; C++17 required;
To work requires SFML (tested on Ubuntu with SFML from the repository);
To work in the build directory, transfer the file "Gidole-Regular.ttf";

Will be added:
Real-time graphing and visualization of sorting (SFML or Qt maybe);
Profiling other algorithms;
